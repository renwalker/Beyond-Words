It appeals both to adults and children and provides an opportunity for them to share these important beliefs. How do we share our beliefs with our children?

The conclusion of the book offers a strong message about personal values. Readers will be enchanted by Shanahan&#39;s beautiful and endearing illustrations, which further serve to illuminate the books heart-warming sentiments.

In the process he captured the culture and personality of 30 different groups as represented by their native dress, celebrations, parades, festivals, and other activities. We Are One collects more than 400 of the most stunning of these images. The book is organized into six historical periods, each focusing on specific ethnic migrations to the New World and their impact on American society. These range from Native Americans and Eskimos in the 1500s, through groups like the Russians and Irish in the 1700s, to the postwar waves of Cubans and Southeast Asians. Edward James Olmos&rsquo;s personal foreword sets the tone for this visual testament of America as a magnificent gathering of diverse and hard-working individuals who individually add to the collective fabric of this great nation. The final chapter features the author&#39;s reflections on diversity and unity.||||28|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

In The Way of the Fertile Soul, Dr. Randine Lewis outlines ten ancient Chinese medical and Taoist &#39;secrets&#39; that hold the little-known key to successfully conceiving babies, new dreams, and a fulfilling life for women at any phase in their lives. Exercises and meditations help align the body, mind, and spirit while unlocking creativity and suppressed energy that can then be redirected toward a balanced, healthy life. With diagnostic questionnaires and qigong breathing exercises, women learn how nature expresses itself within them and how they can tap into this limitless reservoir to reduce stress, correct imbalances, and bring peace to their lives. Using these techniques, women can achieve their dreams, discover new desires, and plant the seeds of wisdom for a fruitful approach to life.||||11.96|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

In an age when Americans spend more than half their waking hours either at work or performing a function related to work, it is important that the workplace be a healthy community rather than a chaotic battleground. This book offers the premise that work can indeed enhance lives as well as pay the bills. The book is neither pro-employer nor pro-employee in its approach. Instead it encourages increasing interdependency, the creation of family, among all staff members to create a healthy work environment.||||8.76|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Everest: A Climb for Peace is not just a typical Everest film, but a socially relevant documentary about peace, war, and the human spirit &mdash; an inspirational film, which also has some of the most incredible Everest footage ever shot, including a dramatic rescue from near the summit of Everest. Filmed on location in Nepal, Tibet, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, U.A.E, and the United States, the film chronicles the spectacular journey of 9 &#39;peace climbers&#39; from different faiths and cultures as they climb to the summit of the tallest mountain in the world. The focus is on Palestinian Ali Bushnaq and Israeli&#39;s Dudu Yifrah and Micha Yaniv. They come together and set aside their differences to forge a path of teamwork and cooperation to attempt to summit the world&rsquo;s highest peak. This however, is easier said than done. Their nations have been embroiled in a brutal war for years; each believes they are on the right side of that war and each knows that on Everest the cooperation of your teammate is a matter of life and death.

When Takeko Hose was accidentally shot and paralyzed from the knees down, she and her husband, David, reached out desperately for divine assistance through a succession of prayers. Every Day God is the record of that remarkable communication. Not a stickler for ritual, a lofty voice from beyond, or an enigma, their God is a warm and caring parent, eager to nurture and love unconditionally all. Comforting and enlightening, the teachings in this book are lighthearted, often humorous, and relevant to modern life. And at the core of each teaching is an invitation to meet this largely undiscovered self within readers&#39; innermost hearts, a self that flows from a person&#39;s own divine source.||||11.96|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Invited by Fidel Castro himself to document his rise to power, the father-son team of Osvaldo and Roberto Salas took hundreds of black-and-white photographs, many of Castro and Che Guevara preparing for battle in the picturesque Sierra Maestra Mountains, their subsequent victory in Havana over the dictator Fulgencio Batista, and the postrevolution days of rebuilding. The infamous Bay of Pigs invasion is told in startling photographs of destruction, boats and planes swamped, burning on the shores of Cuba. Russian airman Yuri Gagarin (the first man in space) and American novelist Ernest Hemingway are but two world figures found in this album of historic photos. Common, everyday Cubans playing out their roles as partisans and farmers lend universality to the remarkable. Roberto Salas&#39; brief remembrances with each photo reveal private conversations and insider&#39;s footnotes, illuminating the meaning of the pictures.||||18.36|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Like The Secret for weight loss, but with a &#39;green&#39;/organic approach, The Gabriel Method works for anyone, any time. By adding back in the nutrients our bodies crave, and learning how to really listen to ourselves, we switch our self-destructive patterns to ones filled with health, joy, and a new, slim body. After reading The Gabriel Method, you will learn:   Your body has a reason why it&#39;s holding on to weight, and it&#39;s not your fault.   Fat is a cushion: a protective barrier that our mind believes is helping to protect us.   If you can change that belief, you can change your body; Stop the cycle of crash dieting and start eating what you want, when you want it.   How to choose healthy, nutritious foods that nourish the cells in your body, not starve them.   Delicious shakes and smoothies, and super-power supplements, that can jump start your success.   The simple way you can train your mind and body to work with your goal of health, not against it.   Eliminate the emotional and mental reasons your body holds on to weight in just 10 minutes a day. It certainly worked for Jon; he lost 225 pounds in two-and-a-half years, going from 409 pounds to 184, without suffering, dieting, or anguishing over his body. Unlike most people who lose an extensive amount of weight, his skin tightened up and now is indistinguishable from that of a person who has been healthy his whole life.||||12|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Miller creates a fresh interpretation of the timeless essays and affirmations of Florence Scovel Shinn, a dynamic and provocative teacher in the New Thought movement in the early 1900s. One of the first authors to make the Law of Attraction accessible to the general public, Shinn is a perfect addition to the Atria/Beyond Words Library of Hidden Knowledge series, which presents books from the old masters rewritten in modern language. Shinn&#39;s distinct philosophy and practical approach are accessible to all with enlightening affirmations and action-based advice throughout her essays. Each chapter is written in short digestible sections, addressing the laws of prosperity, the power of intuition, forgiveness, love, and other prescient and timeless topics. The Game of Life is full of simple and easy ways for readers to put the Law of Attraction into action. This presentation of Shinn&#39;s best known work is quite different from any other simple reprinting of the book available. In addition to Shinn&#39;s original text, Miller offers updated interpretations of each essay that address modern issues and include relevant exercises and summary points for each chapter.||||12|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Author Kathy LeMay breaks through these initial roadblocks to give easy and valuable tools to spur definite and rewarding action, demonstrating how our time, treasure, and talents can make a world of difference.

She defines hado as it relates to one&#39;s everyday life, shares her own story of how she became a hado master, and explains how readers can access this unique source of power. By tapping into their hado power, beginners can sense the hado of other people, objects, and environments. At a more advanced level, practitioners of this art can change physical aspects of their lives (for example, turn aggression into gentleness and change the taste of water). Those who practice hado at the master level can heal physical ailments of their own and others (hands-on or remotely), discover their clairvoyant abilities, and even receive messages from departed loved ones. In a world filled with violence and conflict, hado is an especially important and welcome force. Hado lessons and guidelines for forming a support group for continued practice are included.|||10.47|11.96|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Most often the rift starts with a childhood event&mdash;in his own case, the suicide of his father&mdash;that wounds the soul and induces spiritual alienation. In later life, the rift can manifest itself in a variety of ways, from spiritual longing to physical illness. For more than two decades, Paul Sibcy has been helping people heal their wounded souls. Now, drawing on his own spiritual odyssey as well as on the experiences of people he has counseled, he shows how to mend a rift with God. Sibcy demonstrates how physical wellness is intimately connected with spiritual wholeness. He describes the five major types of &quot;soul wounds&quot; and presents a detailed five-step program for spiritual recovery. For everyone who feels alienated by modern life, this book offers a breakthrough plan for renewal and wellness.||||11.96|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Readers will learn how to create a differently-dimensioned relationship with loved ones they&#39;ve lost and with the loved ones still with them. In The Infinite Thread author Alexandra Kennedy shows us death need not separate us from those we love. Kennedy explains that our lost beloved is within reach-within us-much closer than we think. All that is keeping us from a sense of connection is our untapped imagination. The Infinite Thread will show us how the end of a life can lead to a new beginning with the person we considered lost forever. This inner relationship with the person who has died offers powerful opportunities for healing, resolution, and even guidance. The Infinite Thread is much more than a book on death and mourning. It strips away the veils of mystery surrounding death and describes a map for transcending preconceptions about death and dying. The Infinite Thread illustrates that keeping our loved one alive in our hearts&mdash;and in our minds&mdash;will enable us to make peace with the past and move freely into the future.||||11.96|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

They call|This film will challenge your understanding of how we interact with the spirit world and the notions of healing with assistance from the other side. Just outside the small town of Abadiania, Brazil, one of the most unusual people in the world is about to see a group of strangers dressed in white. He is known to westerners as John of God. They call him a spiritual medium, trance surgeon, healer and miracle worker. What he does and how he does it defies conventional logic.  For over 40 years, John of God has received visitors as a doctor might receive patients. Even though he is not a doctor and has no formal schooling beyond the fourth grade, he has performed countless physical operations &ndash; for free. He uses no anesthesia and patients report little pain. He scraps eyes, inserts surgical clamps up noses and makes incisions with simple instruments &ndash; all while he is supposedly taken over by spirits. There is very little bleeding, few reports of infections and numerous reports of improved health &ndash; both spiritually and physically.  John of God says that God and over 30 compassionate spirits are working through him and he does not remember what he did once he comes out of his trance. We watch him perform these unusual surgeries and follow several people from around the world with various physical problems as they seek help from him and the spirit world.  Laura Van Wagner from Maui has come to John of God to treat a life threatening cancer. Her lymphoma is causing rapid tumor growth in her throat. Kristy First was paralyzed in a car accident in Florida and wants to regain the use of her legs. Roland Nip from Honolulu has been diagnosed with defective heart valve. Izzy Zalcberg, who suffers from depression has traveled from Chicago to Brazil with his wife who has been diagnosed with an incurable cancer. Lynn Debenham, the south of England, will undergo a physical surgery to remove a tumor on her back.  Doctors, as well as patients, are constantly traveling to Brazil to observe the man who can reportedly heal others using spiritual assistance. Reverend Doug Busby, MD from LaPorte, Indiana is a doctor who specializes in preventive medicine. For him, John of God may hold the key to connecting the world of prayer and healing. Philip Bechtel, MD is a neurosurgeon from Fort Worth, Texas who has been to see John of God eleven times. He operates on the deadliest of brain tumors and is looking for a means to help his desperately ill patients. These two highly respected medical doctors have not only observed John of God on several occasions, they have assisted him with surgery. They offer their opinions as to what might be occurring at the healing center known as the Casa de Dom Inacio. &nbsp;|||11.97|15.96|||||N||Y||||IN|689076522939 ||Y|N|Y|USD|

But studies now show that genes are functioning and changing, every minute, every second. According to The Divine Code of Life, dormant genes have the potential to &quot;wake up&quot; and transform personality and outlook. The book shows how mental and emotional factors &mdash; negatives like stress and positives like excitement, joy, gratitude, and spirituality &mdash; are also involved in switching genes on or off. Drawing on recent scientific research and the author&rsquo;s own observations, this book shows that humans can bring forth their talents at any age. How? Dr. Murakami argues that a positive outlook can turn on the genes that are necessary to bring happiness and success into anyone&rsquo;s life and turn off the bad genes. He calls this process &quot;genetic thinking&quot; &mdash; a science-based approach to controlling the genes by cultivating enthusiasm and inspiration.||||15.16|||||N||Y||||OUT||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

This revised edition teaches readers how to find and manage their Identity System, a key component that controls mind, body, and soul. Instead of trying to discover the rationale for our behavior through years of counseling, Dr. Stanley Block, a former Beverly Hills psychoanalyst, shows readers how easy it can be to free themselves from their own expectations. His I-System uses the resting techniques of mapping and bridging, enabling readers to recognize and befriend the thoughts and fears that force them to set patterns that keep them from functioning freely and naturally.

In 2010, His Holiness traveled to New York City to teach A Commentary on Bodhicitta by Nagarjuna and A Guide to the Bodhisattva&rsquo;s Way of Life by Shantideva.  Following the teachings, His Holiness the Dalai Lama went on to address a sold-out crowd at Radio City Music Hall with Awakening the Heart of Selflessness, a public talk followed by a candid question and answer session. In this talk, His Holiness discusses ways in which one can achieve the realization of selflessness and ultimately achieve inner peace, which in turn generates a genuine sense of responsibility for the happiness of others and eventually creates a more compassionate world for everyone.

Must a society lose its traditions in order to move into the future? These are some of the questions posed to His Holiness the Dalai Lama by filmmaker and explorer Rick Ray. Ray examines some of the fundamental questions of our time by weaving together observations from his own journeys throughout India and the Middle East, and the wisdom of an extraordinary spiritual leader. This is his story, as told and filmed by Rick Ray during a private visit to his monastery in Dharamsala, India over the course of several months. Also included is rare historical footage as well as footage supplied by individuals who at great personal risk, filmed with hidden cameras within Tibet. Part biography, part philosophy, part adventure and part politics, 10 Questions for The Dalai Lama conveys more than history and more than answers - it opens a window into the heart of an inspiring man.

And though the 12-step program by itself can often bring initial success, many addicts find themselves relapsing back into old ways and old patterns, or replacing one addiction with another. Author Darren Littlejohn has been there and back, and presents a complimentary guide for recovery to the traditional twelve-step program, out of his own struggles and successes through the study of Zen and Tibetan Buddhism.   Working with the traditional 12-Step philosophy, the author first shares his own life path, and how he came to find the spiritual solace that has greatly enhanced his life in recovery. Then, he details out how his work integrating Buddhism into the traditional twelve-step programs validates both aspects of the recovery process. While being careful not to present himself as a Tibetan lama or Zen master, the author shows how each step -- such as admitting there is a problem, seeking help, engaging in a thorough self-examination, making amends for harm done, and helping other drug addicts who want to recover -- fits into the Bodhisattva path. This integration makes Buddhism accessible for addicts, and the 12 Steps understandable for Buddhists who may otherwise be at a loss to help those in need.   The 12-Step Buddhist is designed to be a complimentary practice to the traditional 12-step journey, not a replacement. While traditional twelve-step programs help addicts become sober by removing the drug of choice and providing a spiritual path, they rarely delve deep into what causes people to suffer in the first place. The integration of Buddhism with the traditional process provides the wisdom and meditations that can help addicts truly find a deep, spiritual liberation from all causes and conditions of suffering -- for good. &nbsp;||||12.8|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Choosing Alex, she begins to see how her decision impacts the entire community. And You Invited Me In is one snapshot of the struggle that has raged within and around religion for centuries.

Endorsed by three Nobel Peace Laureates including Desmond Tutu.

Based on his eleven years as a monk, studying Buddhist philosophy and meditation with the Dalai Lama, as well as his own highly regarded workshops, Awakening Kindness details the many ways we can enrich our lives by simply being kind to each other and ourselves. Nawang includes a range of simple meditations, mantras, and practices that are easy to incorporate into even the busiest modern life.

In spite of colossal challenges and never-ending crises, they have survived for over 60,000 years with joy and peace&mdash;yet their spiritual teachings, the source of their enduring wisdom, have never been fully presented.  For the first time, these ancient oral traditions have been put down onto paper by a researcher so unique, he was featured in American Shaman: an Odyssey of Global Healing Traditions, which won a Best Spiritual Book award from Spirituality &amp; Health magazine. Bradford Keeney takes the reader through the veil of original spirituality, connecting the fragments of world religions to a source that is unlike any other. Through this wisdom, readers can find the deepest meaning, fullest purpose, and highest joy in life.  The Bushman Way of Tracking God is articulated through twelve original mysteries, including: activating the non-subtle universal life force (what the Bushmen call n/om), heightening emotional experience, vibratory interaction, direct downloading and absorption of sacred knowledge, extraordinary healing, activation of the ecstatic &ldquo;pump,&rdquo; spontaneous ways of rejuvenation, attending the spiritual classrooms, so-called telepathy, an uncommon range of mystical experiences, and last but not least, total bliss.||||19.2|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

This insight not only has the capacity to enhance performance in athletics, but also allows anyone to navigate smoothly through life, appreciating the journey along the way.

They are manifestations of the Ultimate Being that can appear at will in human or animal form. When Mother Nature has been harmed by the actions of humans, Avatars restore the karmic balance while showing humans the way back to the higher realms. In Spiritual Teachings of the Avatar, author Jeffrey Armstrong enlightens us on the real meaning of the word Avatar and its relevance today. Culled from Vedic spiritual traditions of India that can be traced back more than 5,000 years, Armstrong illuminates how contemporary cultural references to Avatars reveal their deep and enlightening historical roots. At the heart of these teachings is a respect for all life, the concept that we are each part of the same Ultimate Being, and where everyone is able to makes the journey back home to the Divine. With the social, economic, environmental, and political unrest in the world today, these lessons from the Avatar are more important than ever. Learn more here.||||17.6|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

The Dalai Lama could actually be China&#39;s best friend if the leadership would accept him as their ally.  Since the illegal Chinese invasion of Tibet in the 1950&#39;s, Tibetans have seen their religion, language, and culture repressed, their ecosystem compromised, and systematic oppression and violence against anyone who professes loyalty to the Dalai Lama. Despite all this, the Dalai Lama has been a consistent voice for peace, offering a Middle Way Approach that has garnered accolades from the Nobel Peace Prize to the US Congressional Gold Medal.  Robert Thurman details this approach in five steps that the Chinese leadership can easily accomplish now by granting Tibet true autonomy within China, mending relations with the Dalai Lama, and dedicating the Tibetan Plateau as the world&#39;s largest environmental preserve.

Author an|The Sacred Promise brings us into the laboratory of scientist Dr. Gary Schwartz, where he establishes the existence of Spirit by its own Willful Intent&mdash;a proof of concept for deceased spirits. The author takes readers on a personal journey into the world of angels and spirits and reveals their existence and desire to help. Dr. Schwartz candidly discusses the challenges as well as the rewards of connecting with Spirit. He poses several important questions. What if our feelings of emptiness, loneliness, hopelessness, and meaninglessness are actually fostered by our belief in a &ldquo;spiritless&rdquo; Universe? What if our physical hunger is symptomatic of a greater spiritual hunger? What if Spirit is actually all around us, ready to fill us with energy, hope, and direction, if we are ready to ingest it? What if Spirit is like air and water, readily available for us to draw within; that is, if we choose to seek it? The Sacred Promise shows how we can attune ourselves and receive this guidance from Spirit, which is all scientifically documented by Dr. Schwartz experiments and research.

Partnering With Nature weaves together historical, spiritual and scientific information and offers personal anecdotes and real stories of how nature has changed people&rsquo;s lives as well as shaped the course of human evolution. People struggle daily with stressful jobs&mdash;trapped in blank walls, smelling chemicals, sitting in one chair, staring at glowing screens&mdash;when they should be outdoors, enjoying the beauty of nature and the connection with other living things. It is vital that we understand how important nature is in our daily lives, health, and sense of well-being.  Partnering with Nature speaks to conscious readers who feel a deep connection with nature in their lives, who are becoming more aware of how they feel when distanced from nature. Readers will resonate with MacGregor&#39;s answers and the historical precedent for a true partnership with nature.  Catriona explains:   How a disconnect with nature can lead to stress and depression in adults and obesity, attention deficit disorders, and apathy in children.   Why a connection with the Earth and with nature, in its many forms, is vital to human survival; why we need to be active participants with nature, not just casual observers.   The history of many cultures&rsquo; relationships to the Earth, including what the many varieties of origin myths mean to us today.   How the energies that link humans, animals, and the natural world can actually be observed and studied&mdash;the point where spirituality and science intersect.   What the myriad benefits are of truly being in partnership with nature.||||12.8|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

New technological advances have confirmed what many have believed&mdash;that there is more to our world than meets the eye. Orbs: The Veil is Lifting shows how modern digital photography allows us to observe the hidden world of light spheres known as Orbs. Bringing together scientists, spiritualists, and experts, Orbs is the first full-length documentary to address and explore the Orb phenomenon. What are these Orbs? What does the presence of Orbs mean, and how do we experience them for ourselves? Through the lenses of science, skepticism, and first-hand experience, Orbs opens the conversation by addressing questions about the possibilities of what exists in the unseen. Viewers are then invited to draw their own conclusions and to explore their own first-hand experiences. The veil between dimensions is thinning with our increase in consciousness.||||15.96|||||N||Y||||IN|724868021365||Y|N|Y|USD|

In The Orb Project, two researchers present their fascinating discoveries about the nature of orbs, the situations in which their presence could be most easily detected, and what implications they might have for understanding humans&#39; place in the cosmos. The authors have taken hundreds of thousands of photographs of orbs, so they offer practical tips that amateur digital photographers can use to capture images and properly distinguish them from false orbs, those that are dust or water particles and not emanations from spirit beings. They also offer guidelines on deciphering the orbs&#39; various patterns, features, and characteristics. Once a person has become experienced in photographing orbs, it&#39;s possible for the brain to stop censoring these images, and he or she can begin to see orbs with the naked eye&mdash;in more color and detail than is possible through a digital camera.||||15.16|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

King&#39;s personal history, vision, and insights are finally compiled in a comprehensive volume and in his own words.

The grandson of both Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, King speaks with an unwavering voice that resonates with the struggle of his people and celebrates the endurance of their spirit. He was a great leader in his own right, a respected Elder of the Lakota (Sioux) Nation who offered steadfast commitment to his people and to the land that was his home. He was one of the preeminent leaders of the great Indian Reawakening that began in the late 1960s. He gave political and spiritual counsel to the American Indian Movement (AIM) during and after the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee.

Miller interprets a few essential essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson that tell us how the world always&nbsp;responds to our thoughts, words, and actions, and what we can do to ensure that our life is truly joy-filled in all&nbsp;aspects. In clear, simple language, she gives us a direct sense of what Emerson felt, saw, and struggled to share with&nbsp;his fellow human beings. Emerson transcended the limitations of his day. Using common sense, a love of nature, and his own particular&nbsp;genius, he expressed a higher truth about who we are and how the world gives us exactly what we demand from it. Yet, perhaps because he was so popular, and because so much of what was popularized focused on the need to&nbsp;transcend materialism and reconnect with Nature, some of his core ideas were lost to later generations. They were&nbsp;there, buried in the long sentences and extended paragraphs of his often-overlooked essays&mdash;but were discovered&nbsp;only by the few who were willing to take the time and seek them out. These few became great teachers in their own&nbsp;right, the founders and leaders of institutions and movements that have changed history. Natural Abundance makes the hidden treasures of Emerson&rsquo;s wisdom accessible to 21st century readers. Through it,&nbsp;this great man&rsquo;s alignment of his heart&rsquo;s knowing and his intellect&rsquo;s understanding can lead all of us to a more abundantly fulfilling life, today. &nbsp;||||11.2|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Some turn to psychotherapy and counseling for help, some turn to spiritual teachings, and many turn to both. The Next Ten Minutes is the guide to help us discover the seeds of transformation and meaning in even the most ordinary routines. The Next Ten Minutes consists of a collection of exercises originally created for use in Dr. Peterson&#39;s successful counseling practice. Rather than taking readers out of the everyday, Dr. Peterson invites them to move more deeply into the familiar tasks of ordinary life, such as turning simple breathing, eating, physical love, or throwing out the trash into meditative exercises that can transform your day. Based on both Buddhist philosophy and proven psychology techniques, these succinct and accessible meditations also offer simple and effective methods for therapeutic counseling and personal growth. The power to seize the day is but a few simple steps away.|||12.59|14.392|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Some of the most incredible miracles in history came from applying a simple code, activating the power of the creative force of God in the world. This ancient technology has largely been lost or ignored since then, only to be revealed once again through this movie (as well as James Twyman&rsquo;s book of the same name). This code, if finally applied to humanity, has the power to transform the planet, as well as add the richest blessings to all of us.  Some of the best-known spiritual teachers in the world join James in this film, and offer tools that show us how we can apply the Moses Code to our lives. This is the foundation upon which the Law of Attraction was built. The film focuses on the power of &quot;Soul Manifestation,&quot; drawing upon our own innate spiritual ability to produce miracles everywhere we go. Many other films and books have focused on using the Law of Attraction to &quot;get&quot; the things we believe we need&mdash;for example, houses, cars, or other goods.

He suddenly discovered that by lightly touching his clients while at the same time applying focused intent, he could restore them to a physically, mentally, and spiritually balanced state, instantly shifting misalignments that had plagued them for years. Most astonishing of all, he could teach anyone how to do this. Now, for millions of people looking for empowerment in an age of declining and impersonal healthcare, Dr. Bartlett shares this phenomenon in a book full of explosive potential. In Matrix Energetics, Dr. Bartlett builds upon his popular seminars to teach us how to access the discovery he has made&mdash;a process that merges the science of subtle energy with our innate imaginations to produce measurable results. By applying forces known to modern physics, each of us can tap into states of healthy awareness from different moments&mdash;in essence, travel in time&mdash;and bring them into the present for immediate, profound results. As Dr. Bartlett clearly shows, this practice requires no special training, produces transformation in the blink of an eye, and is available to everyone who has a willingness to learn. Matrix Energetics, The Science and Art of Transformation, provides an easily-reproducible, results-oriented process of change that draws on the fundamental principles embraced by the field of quantum physics.

He suddenly discovered that by lightly touching his clients while at the same time applying focused intent, he could restore them to a physically, mentally, and spiritually balanced state, instantly shifting misalignments that had plagued them for years. Most astonishing of all, he could teach anyone how to do this. Now, for millions of people looking for empowerment in an age of declining and impersonal healthcare, Dr. Bartlett shares this phenomenon in a book full of explosive potential. In Matrix Energetics, Dr. Bartlett builds upon his popular seminars to teach us how to access the discovery he has made&mdash;a process that merges the science of subtle energy with our innate imaginations to produce measurable results. By applying forces known to modern physics, each of us can tap into states of healthy awareness from different moments&mdash;in essence, travel in time&mdash;and bring them into the present for immediate, profound results. As Dr. Bartlett clearly shows, this practice requires no special training, produces transformation in the blink of an eye, and is available to everyone who has a willingness to learn. Matrix Energetics, The Science and Art of Transformation, provides an easily-reproducible, results-oriented process of change that draws on the fundamental principles embraced by the field of quantum physics.

She begins with her most basic concept: The way you eat is inseparable from your core beliefs about being alive. Your relationship with food is an exact mirror of your feelings about love, fear, anger, meaning, transformation and, yes, even God. She shows how going beyond both the food and feelings takes you deeper into realms of spirit and soul to the bright center of your own life, and reveals how your relationship with food is the doorway to freedom and what you want most: the demystification of weight loss, and the luminous presence that so many of us call &quot;God.&quot;  A knock-your-socks-off ride to a deeply fulfilling relationship with food, your body&hellip;and almost everything else, Women Food and God is, quite simply, a guide for life.||||19.2|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Would you think it an odd tool for healing? Would you think you weren&rsquo;t flexible enough? Would you think it would cost too much to find a good teacher and class?

This often leaves people longing to lead a &quot;seamless&quot; life, one in which the separate parts of our personalities are united as a whole. The key to achieving this quality of life is authenticity, the ability to be yourself. Your Authentic Self explores the notion that when you are authentic with yourself, you can begin to extend that to your relationships with others and your work life, ultimately improving all aspects of your life. Your Authentic Self provides readers with practical advice on getting the most from their work experience, at the same time giving their absolute best to their work and their employers. By being ourselves in the context of our jobs, we gain access to hidden gifts, including creativity, intuition, and innovation, each of which benefits both the individual and the organization. Your Authentic Self begins with the author&#39;s personal story of discovering the value in accessing his own unique brand of authenticity in the workplace. Supported by the author&#39;s experience in some of America&#39;s leading corporations, the book then explains how most of us come to understand that authenticity in the workplace is not a good idea. The author provides more than forty clearly explained and immediately usable tools and techniques for gaining access to your authenticity and how to hold onto it even in the context of the workplace. These principles, tools, and techniques are practical and they work! Most importantly, anyone reading this book can immediately begin incorporating these concepts in their lives, often experiencing instant positive results and making the shift from seeing work as &quot;off the path of personal and spiritual growth&quot; to seeing it as an integral part of the journey.||||11.96|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

Most chronic conditions are self-induced and are a product of lifestyles and the result of an imbalance of chemicals that our own bodies produce. The good news is that Your Inner Pharmacy offers realistic options that can give a person five, ten, even twenty more years of quality time that can delay, postpone, and often minimize the onset of chronic disease. By devoting ten percent of leisure time to healthy aging activities (roughly five hours a week), a person can affect the progression of these preventable chronic diseases. Readers create their own commonsense Health plan, an organized program of weekly health-promoting activities, stress reduction, diet, exercise, and routine maintenance to help increase their longevity and quality of life.||||15.96|||||N||Y||||IN||10|Y|N|Y|USD|

A genuine paradigm shift. While mainstream science remains materialist, a substantial number of scientists are supporting and developing a new paradigm based on the primacy of consciousness. Amit Goswami, PhD, a pioneer of this revolutionary new perspective shares with us his vision of the unlimited potential of consciousness as the ground of all being, and how this revelation helps us to live better. It tells the story of a man who challenges us to rethink our very notions of existence and reality, with a force and scope not felt since Einstein. With a poignant relevance, Dr. Goswami demonstrates how our views of reality have led to our current environmental, social,&nbsp; economic, and spiritual crisis, and presents a course of action. At stake is nothing less than our survival upon the planet.||||19.96|||||N||Y||||OUT|809070215327||Y|N|Y|USD|
